After a important 4.4 release that brought many improvements to the support for mensural notation and a new importer for [CMME](https://www.cmme.org/), Verovio 4.5 is now out! This version integrates luth tablature developments to be released in MEI 5.1.

This release of Verovio will be the last of version 4 releases since we are now adopting a [new versioning scheme](https://github.com/rism-digital/verovio/discussions/3891) where the major number will be increased once per year, with version 5 in 2025. Switching to a development version of MEI will happen independently, whenever appropriate, which will give us more flexibility in integrating upcoming MEI features.
