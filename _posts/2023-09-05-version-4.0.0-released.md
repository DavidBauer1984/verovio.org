Verovio 4.0 is out! This is the first release based on MEI 5.0 and is an important milestone for the project. MEI 5.0 will remain the base for additional releases of Verovio 4.x. As always, this release includes various improvements. See the [release announcement](https://github.com/rism-digital/verovio/releases/tag/version-4.0.0) for more details about these.

The release of Verovio 4.0 follows the release scheme adopted since Verovio 2.0, which is to have even version numbers for Verovio releases implementing only features available in a stable version of MEI, and odd version numbers for releases based on a development version of MEI. When the MEI community will move to the development of MEI 6.0, and that some of the new MEI features will be implemented into Verovio while still being in a MEI development phase, Verovio will move to 5.0.
